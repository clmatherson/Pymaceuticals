Pymaceuticals Analysis

Observations:

The Boxplot of Final Tumor Volume across the four regimens of interest show data sets are relatively normal.

Of the four regimens of interest, Capomulin appears to be the most promising. 

The Capomulin Regimen Correlation and Regression chart shows a positive coefficient of 0.84.
This indicates a strong relationship between a mouse's weight and its average tumor volume.

Mouse ID g288 shows a positive response to the Capomulin regimen, as Tumor Volumes trends downward overtime.

The population could be divided by gender. An analysis based on gender could help determine if there is a relationship between a mouse's response to a regimen and its gender.
